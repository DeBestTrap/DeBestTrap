# Welcome! よこそう！ 欢迎光临！
I am currently a Junior by year and Senior by credit persuing a Dual in Computer Systems Engineering and Computer Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). I am also planning on doing a Co-Term at RPI in CS specializing in ML.

## Currently working on:
* Learning the web framework Django to develop a website for my custom domain.
* [Overlord Bot](https://github.com/jwgit9/Overlord-Bot), a Discord bot developed by RPI students in RCOS.
* Updating my previous Discord bots [Ferris](https://github.com/DeBestTrap/ferris-bot) and [Sekaidle](https://github.com/DeBestTrap/sekaidle) to utilize new Discord.py 2.0.0 features.
